description: Demo step 2 - build the session countdown web app inside the generated demo project.
---

Skip clarification. Do not ask clarifying questions and do not wait for plan confirmation. Build this end to end, verify it, and report the result when finished.

## Objective

Build a functional web app for the demo session titled **Skills Orchestrator**.

## Content

- Page and heading title: `Skills Orchestrator`
- Welcome line: `Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Skills Orchestrator Session`

## Schedule

- Scheduled start: **2:00 PM Central Time on September 17, 2026**. Use the ISO value `2026-09-17T14:00:00-05:00`; the `-05:00` offset is correct because Central is on daylight time in September.
- The session lasts **60 minutes**.
- Render all displayed times through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with time zone `America/Chicago` so they stay correct on any machine.

## Behavior

Three phases, driven by the current time:

1. **Before the start time** - show `Starting soon`, the scheduled start time, and a live countdown until the start.
2. **Between start and start + 60 minutes** - show a live countdown to the end of the session.
3. **After start + 60 minutes** - show a thank-you message with the presenter's contact information.

## Test mode

- Provide a test mode that reads the current date and time and sets the start time to **30 minutes before now**, so the page is mid-session with a visibly moving countdown.
- Test mode is the default. A `?mode=live` query parameter selects the real schedule and `?mode=test` forces test mode.
- Show a visible badge indicating which mode is active, so the wrong mode is never presented by accident.
- Support an `?at=<ISO timestamp>` override that pins the clock, so any phase can be previewed instantly during rehearsal.

## Presenter information

Put the presenter details in a single configuration module, keeping each link's display label separate from its URL so the rendered text stays readable:

| Field | Display | Link target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presenter | Anthony Marsiglia | - |
| Role | Principal Cloud Solution Architect | - |
| Email | anmarsig@microsoft.com | `mailto:anmarsig@microsoft.com` |
| LinkedIn | anthony-marsiglia-045b30b2 | `https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-marsiglia-045b30b2` |
| GitHub | QuyDu/Skills-Orchestrator | `https://github.com/QuyDu/Skills-Orchestrator` |

Every URL must carry an explicit `https://` scheme; a scheme-less value such as `www.linkedin.com/...` resolves as a relative path and produces a broken link. Render outbound links with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## Scannable codes

On the **thank-you screen only**, show three QR codes so the audience can capture your details:

1. **Save contact** - a vCard 3.0 payload carrying the name, role, email, and both URLs. Use CRLF line endings; some scanners reject an LF-only card.
2. **LinkedIn** - the LinkedIn profile URL.
3. **GitHub repo** - the repository URL.

Generate every code as an SVG at build time using `qrcode` as an exact-pinned devDependency, writing into the build output directory. Do not fetch QR images from an external service at runtime: the demo must work without internet, and the presenter's details must not be sent to a third party. Use error-correction level `M` and a white background so they scan reliably from a projector. Give every code descriptive alt text.

## Implementation requirements

- TypeScript compiled with `tsc`, matching the project's declared stack. No runtime dependencies; QR generation happens at build time only.
- Keep all schedule and phase logic in a pure module with no DOM access, so it is unit testable.
- Add unit tests using `node:test` covering: the published start time formats as 2:00 PM CDT on September 17 2026, test mode backdates the start by 30 minutes, phase boundaries at start and at start + 60 minutes, countdown formatting, and that countdowns never go negative.
- Wire `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm start`. `npm start` must serve the app locally with a zero-dependency Node static server that refuses to serve files outside the project root.
- Follow the scoped instructions in `.github/instructions/`.

## Verification

Run the tests, start the server, and confirm in the browser that all three phases render correctly.

## Deployment to Azure Government

After the app builds and every test passes, deploy it using the project's own governed entry point at `infra/deploy.ps1`. Do not author a new deployment skill and do not hand-roll `az deployment` calls.

Use `skillsdemo` as the site name. It is 10 characters, inside the 12-character limit, and yields the resource group `rg-skillsdemo`.

1. Confirm Azure CLI is available, signed in, and targeting Azure Government. `az cloud show --query name -o tsv` must return `AzureUSGovernment` and `az account show --query id -o tsv` must return a subscription ID. If Azure CLI is unavailable, authentication is missing, or the cloud is not Azure Government, stop and report the exact prerequisite; do not switch clouds or start an interactive login during the demo.
2. Explain that deployment will create `rg-skillsdemo`, billable Azure Government resources, and a public endpoint. **Stop here and ask the presenter for explicit approval before any Azure mutation.** Proceed only on an explicit yes.
3. After approval, create the resource group, then preview the exact changes:

   ```powershell
   az group create --name rg-skillsdemo --location usgovvirginia -o none
   ./infra/deploy.ps1 -SiteName skillsdemo -AzureGov -Location usgovvirginia -AppServiceSku B1 -NoKeyVault -WhatIf
   ```

   The resource group must exist before `-WhatIf`, because the preview uses a resource-group deployment.

4. Show the complete preview. Stop and report if it contains unexpected changes. On the already granted approval, run the same deployment command without `-WhatIf`, then publish the built site to the created web app and report the resulting HTTPS URL.
5. The application must bind to the port supplied by App Service through `process.env.PORT`. Set an explicit startup command if the platform does not detect one.
6. Verify the deployed URL over HTTPS: confirm the page loads and that all three phases render using the `?mode=` and `?at=` overrides.

Never place secrets, connection strings, or service keys in app settings; the web app authenticates with its managed identity.

## Constraints

- Do not commit or push.
- Do not add runtime dependencies.
