# azure-cleanup

## Purpose

Identify Azure resources associated with the current project and prepare or execute a narrowly scoped cleanup. The default behavior is read-only discovery. Destructive cleanup requires an explicit confirmation after the exact subscription, cloud, resource group, and resources are displayed.

## Preconditions

- Read the project handoff and Azure Discovery reports when present.
- Confirm the project resource-group naming convention and active Azure CLI account.
- Verify the target cloud is Azure Commercial or Azure US Government.
- Treat all resource names and resource groups as untrusted until ownership is verified.

## Inputs

- Optional `-All` to remove the verified project resource group.
- Optional `-Resource "name"` to remove one verified resource.
- Optional `-RG "name"` to inspect or remove one named resource group.
- Optional `-Commercial` or `-Gov`; without either, ask `1. Commercial` or `2. Gov`.
- Optional `-WhatIf` for read-only output. This is the default behavior.

## Approved Tools and Resources

- `infra/cleanup.ps1`.
- Azure CLI read-only listing and resource-show commands.
- Existing project manifest, Azure Discovery report, and deployment configuration.

## Read and Write Boundaries

- Read Azure account, cloud, resource-group, and resource metadata.
- Write only cleanup evidence under `reports/azure-cleanup.json` and `reports/azure-cleanup.md`.
- Delete only the explicitly confirmed resource or verified project resource group.
- Never delete a resource or group based only on a name match, and never record credentials.

## Procedure

1. Resolve the cloud using `-Commercial`, `-Gov`, or the numeric menu. Accept only `1` or `2`; after three invalid responses, exit with an error.
2. Verify the active Azure CLI cloud matches the selected cloud and display the signed-in subscription name and ID.
3. Resolve the target scope. `-All` targets the project resource group after ownership checks; `-Resource` requires `-RG` or a uniquely resolved project resource; `-RG` targets the named group.
4. List the exact target and associated resources before any mutation.
5. Write a cleanup report containing scope, account metadata, cloud, resources, `WhatIf`, and findings.
6. In `-WhatIf` mode, stop after reporting what would be deleted.
7. Otherwise ask for explicit confirmation that names the exact scope, then delete one approved scope.
8. Re-list the target, record remaining resources or deletion errors, and update the cleanup report.

## Validation

- No cleanup mutation occurs during `-WhatIf`.
- The report identifies the exact cloud, subscription, resource group, and requested scope.
- `-All` cannot target a group that fails project-ownership verification.
- `-Resource` deletes only the exact resource ID selected by the user.
- Every success, skip, warning, and error is recorded.
- The post-cleanup listing confirms deletion or explains why it remains.

## Outputs

- `reports/azure-cleanup.json`
- `reports/azure-cleanup.md`

## Failure Behavior

- Stop on ambiguous ownership, multiple resource matches, cloud mismatch, missing authentication, or unexpected Azure CLI errors.
- After three invalid cloud selections, report an error and exit.
- Never fall back from a failed ownership check to deleting by name.
- Preserve cleanup evidence even when deletion is partial or fails.

## Approval Gates

`-WhatIf` and discovery are read-only. `-All`, `-Resource`, and destructive `-RG` operations require explicit confirmation immediately before mutation. Cleanup never authorizes deployment, credential changes, or unrelated resource deletion.

## Composition and Dependencies

- azure-discovery
- project-handoff
- policy-engine

## Examples

- `/azure-cleanup -WhatIf`
- `/azure-cleanup -RG rg-contoso-api -WhatIf -Commercial`
- `/azure-cleanup -Resource app-contoso-api -RG rg-contoso-api -Gov`
- `/azure-cleanup -All -Commercial` then confirm the displayed project resource group.
