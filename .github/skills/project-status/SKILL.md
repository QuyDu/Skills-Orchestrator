# project-status

## Purpose

Produce one current, evidence-backed project status report. When `.azure/environment.json` identifies a subscription, query the declared Azure cloud read-only for project resources and health evidence.

## Preconditions

- Read the current handoff, execution state, manifest, and Azure profile when present.
- Use only the Azure cloud and subscription recorded in the project profile.

## Inputs

- Current project root, optional status window, source revision, and project-local sync or deployment evidence.

## Approved Tools and Resources

- Read-only file, Git, Azure CLI, and Azure Resource Graph inspection.
- The project-local Azure environment profile and cloud endpoint catalog.

## Read and Write Boundaries

- Read source, reports, Git metadata, and Azure resource metadata.
- Write only `reports/project-status.json` and `reports/project-status.md`.
- Never deploy, start, stop, sync, login, switch clouds, or mutate Azure resources.

## Procedure

1. Read authoritative local state and Git `HEAD`.
2. Inspect `.azure/environment.json`. When it has a subscription and endpoint catalog, use its cloud context for read-only Azure resource inventory and App Service state checks.
3. Discover project resource names from Azure deployment reports, IaC outputs, and Azure resource-group naming metadata. Report no deployment evidence when none exists.
4. Read sync reports, event streams, and heartbeat records when present. Mark a sync `failed` on its latest failure; mark it `stale` when its latest success or heartbeat is older than the declared interval plus grace period; otherwise report `unknown` when no observable evidence exists.
5. Compare local Git `HEAD`, the latest validated CI artifact when recorded, and a deployed build/version marker when observable. Never report current when the deployed marker is absent.
6. Publish the report and classify each unavailable evidence source as `unknown`.

## Validation

- The report validates against `schemas/project-status.schema.json`.
- Azure results identify the cloud and subscription from the profile and never infer a Commercial or Government endpoint.
- Every `current`, `healthy`, `failed`, or `stale` conclusion includes evidence.

## Outputs

- `reports/project-status.json`
- `reports/project-status.md`

## Failure Behavior

- Return partial status when Azure authentication, health, sync, CI, or deployment markers are unavailable.
- Never report an unavailable resource, sync, or deployment as healthy or current.

## Approval Gates

- This skill is read-only. Azure login, deployment, sync execution, restart, cleanup, commit, and push require separate approval.

## Composition and Dependencies

- project-handoff
- workflow-telemetry
- audit-azure-environment

## Examples

- Report whether a deployed Azure Government web app is running and matches the local Git revision.
- Report that a scheduled data sync is stale because its heartbeat exceeds its configured interval.
