# audit-azure-environment

## Purpose

Perform an evidence-based, read-only Azure security, reliability, governance, cost, and configuration assessment.

## Preconditions

- Read repository instructions and applicable configuration.
- Inspect authoritative existing artifacts before replacing derived views.
- Verify that this skill owns the requested decision or output.

## Inputs

- Audit scope: tenant, subscriptions, management groups, resource groups, and exclusions.
- Security, reliability, governance, and cost priorities plus required policy baselines.
- Collected Azure evidence: resource inventories, policy states, identity assignments, diagnostics, and billing signals.

## Approved Tools and Resources

- Use read-only repository inspection by default.
- Use deterministic scripts and schema validators when provided.
- Use mutating tools only within the approved workflow boundary.

## Read and Write Boundaries

- Write only the owned reports listed below.
- Never rewrite accepted event-stream records.
- Do not silently mutate source, infrastructure, external systems, or unrelated artifacts.

## Procedure

1. Confirm scope boundaries, data sources, and read-only constraints before collecting findings.
2. Evaluate security posture: identity/RBAC, network exposure, secret handling, encryption, and threat-protection configuration.
3. Evaluate reliability posture: HA/DR settings, backup coverage, monitoring/alerting, and service resiliency patterns.
4. Evaluate governance posture: policy compliance, tagging, resource hygiene, and management guardrails.
5. Evaluate cost posture: overprovisioning, orphaned resources, commitment opportunities, and anomaly indicators.
6. Record findings with evidence references, impact, confidence, and remediation direction while separating verified facts from assumptions.
7. Emit the machine-readable report with explicit limitations for unavailable evidence.

## Validation

- Every finding includes reproducible evidence path, affected scope, impact, and confidence.
- No recommendation implies mutation execution by this skill.
- Audit limitations and inaccessible data sources are explicit.
- Output is internally consistent and consumable by downstream review.

## Outputs

- `reports/azure-audit-findings.json`

## Failure Behavior

- Fail closed when scope authority or evidence provenance cannot be established.
- Return a partial assessment only when covered scope is explicit and separated from unknown scope.
- Never claim compliance or safety for areas without supporting evidence.

## Approval Gates

This skill is read-only; require separate explicit approval for any command that mutates Azure resources or policy state.

## Composition and Dependencies

- None

## Examples

- Assess a subscription's security and policy drift while preserving evidence for formal review.
- Produce a cost and reliability risk summary for resources in a scoped resource group set.
