# project-knowledge-capture

## Purpose

Transform verified decisions, lessons, patterns, anti-patterns, and architecture discoveries into reusable project knowledge.

## Preconditions

- Read repository instructions and applicable configuration.
- Inspect authoritative existing artifacts before replacing derived views.
- Verify that this skill owns the requested decision or output.

## Inputs

- Verified project continuity records from `project-handoff` outputs.
- Evidence for decisions, outcomes, incidents, and remediation effectiveness.
- Existing knowledge artifacts to avoid duplicate or contradictory entries.

## Approved Tools and Resources

- Use read-only repository inspection by default.
- Use deterministic scripts and schema validators when provided.
- Use mutating tools only within the approved workflow boundary.

## Read and Write Boundaries

- Write only the owned reports listed below.
- Never rewrite accepted event-stream records.
- Do not silently mutate source, infrastructure, external systems, or unrelated artifacts.

## Procedure

1. Gather candidate knowledge signals from handoffs, validated outcomes, and recurring issues.
2. Filter to verified facts and explicitly exclude unconfirmed hypotheses.
3. Normalize entries into reusable forms: decision, lesson, pattern, anti-pattern, and architecture note.
4. Attach context, trigger conditions, constraints, and evidence provenance to each entry.
5. Merge duplicates by root concept while preserving distinct evidence trails.
6. Publish machine-readable and markdown knowledge artifacts.

## Validation

- Each knowledge entry maps to at least one verified evidence source.
- Entries distinguish universally reusable guidance from context-specific caveats.
- Contradictory entries are resolved or marked with explicit uncertainty.
- Outputs remain traceable and consumable by downstream memory workflows.

## Outputs

- `reports/knowledge.json`
- `reports/knowledge-capture.md`

## Failure Behavior

- Fail closed when evidence provenance for claimed lessons is missing.
- Emit blocked status when conflicting evidence cannot be reconciled.
- Never promote speculative advice as verified project knowledge.

## Approval Gates

Require explicit approval before publishing knowledge externally or applying knowledge-driven policy changes.

## Composition and Dependencies

- project-handoff

## Examples

- Convert repeated rollback incidents into an anti-pattern with clear prevention guidance.
- Capture a verified design decision with conditions where it should not be reused.
